\chapter{The First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope}

The First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) is a small IACT located on the Canary island of La Palma.
It measures air-shower-photons with a $\SI{9.5}{\meter\squared}$ aperture provided by a segmented imaging-reflector with $\SI{4.889}{\meter}$ focal-length.
Apart from monitoring bright sources of cosmic gamma-rays, like Markarian 421 and 501, FACT is used for demonstrating and testing the usage of new technologies in the field of IACTs. Giving it its name, FACT uses a novel kind of detector made of so called Geiger-mode avalanche photomultipliers. These photomultipliers make up the 1440 pixels of Silicon-Photo-Multipliers (SiPM), FACT uses to sense photons. Each pixel yields about $\SI{0.1}{\degree}$ field-of-view, giving FACT a total field-of-view of $\SI{4.5}{\degree}$. Using SiPMs instead of Photo-Multiplier-Tubes (PMTs) differentiates FACT from other IACTs and gives it special possibilities.
