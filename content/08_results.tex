\chapter{Results and Performance}
%
The generation of the data from the calibrated time series, i.e. the direct
detector response on air-shower photons, is what differs the PhotonStream data
from previous data representations. By finding single photons the goal is to
neglect the noise that is intrinsic when integrating over time series and
getting a more accurate time information. However, the results of this procedure
yield a different data set, so it is important to investigate the differences.

\section{Photon Extraction}
%
The photon extraction is the key difference when generating PhotonStream data.
It does not calculate the photon features from the time series but aims at
finding the single photon pulses, which opens the possibility of generating
arrival times per photon and hopefully yields an accurate description of the
air-showers. When comparing the PhotonStream data to the standard data
representation, the intuitive questions at hand are:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the difference concerning the number of reconstructed photons?
  \item What is the difference in the number of noise photons?
  \item What is the difference between simulations and data?
\end{enumerate}
%
To answer these questions the images for specific events generated by the
photon extraction can be compared to the standard LP images. In
\autoref{fig:difference} and \autoref{fig:difference2} different data events
from a single run are shown for both data representations. The top camera image
shows the PE as generated by the photon extractor for the PhotonStream. The
bottom image shows the PE as generated from the LP of the time series. The
middle image shows the difference of both images in PE per pixel.

For those four example events a clear picture evolves: The difference between
both images is nearly always positive, meaning the photon extractor is
generally finding more photons in the time series. Furthermore, the biggest
differences lie within the air-shower pixels. So it seems that the difference
is dependant on the brightness, i.e. the photon extractor generates a bigger
PE difference for very bright pixels. Lastly, the difference in noise pixels is
very close to zero with small deviations in both directions.

Apart from these deviations, the PhotonStream data frequently contains a small
cluster of photons a few pixel rows above the camera center (e.g. in event 51,
\autoref{fig:difference}). These photons are not found in LP data. When
observing the Crab Nebula there is another bright star in the field of view of
the telescope: [NAME]. The light of this star is causing the bright spots in
the PhotonStream data. These spots are not visible in the LP data, because
it only contains a small time frame around the largest pulse, i.e. the
air-shower. This way, there is only a small part of the star's light present in
the event, which is not enough to significantly differ it from background
light. Luckily, the DBSCAN clustering intrinsically does not classify these
photons as air-shower photons. The space-time topology of a steady but faint
source apparently does not suit the clustering criteria.

\autoref{fig:pe_diffs} shows the distribution of the PE differences as
described above accumulated for 300 events. The PhotonStream data on average contains
aorund 2 PE more than the corresponding LP event. However, as is visible in
\autoref{fig:pe_diffs_log} there is quite a number of pixels deviating by up to
20 PE. This reflects the observations from the four example events discussed
above: the majority of pixels contains one to two PE more than the PhotonStream
data while the few shower pixels contain a larger amount of PE more than the LP
data.
