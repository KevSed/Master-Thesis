\section{Image Cleaning on the PhotonStream}\label{sec:phs_clean}
%
As pointed out in \autoref{ch:iact} the Cherenkov-light of air-showers shows a
very specific topology. The emitted photons are coherent in space and time:
they originate from a single very high energetic and therefore very fast
primary particle and thus appear in a very brief time window of a few
nanoseconds. Furthermore, the characteristic Cherenkov-angle under which the
light is emitted, creates a light cone, which, when projected to the
$x$-$y$-plane of the camera causes the specific elliptical shape. Both of these
topological features are mandated by the physical process and can therefore be
unrestrictedly used for the cleaning. Background events like ambient light or
starlight don't show these characteristics and tend to appear randomly.

The threedimensional $xyt$-representation of the PhotonStream's point-cloud
quantifies photons with exactly those three observables. Thus, a cleaning
within the threedimensional space-time can heavily use the known topology.
Within the point-cloud, an air-shower will appear as a very dense cluster of
photons, surrounded by a merely isotropic distribution of background photons.
These characteristics of shower events in the PhotonStream representation
naturally suggest a density-based clustering algorithm as the cleaning method
of choice. The two challenges at hand are the choice of a suited algorithm and
a well defined metric to make the threedimensional spacetime usable.

\subsection{Air-showers in the point-cloud}
%
The threedimensional spacetime of the PhotonStream and its representation as a
point-cloud eventually mixes spatial dimensions with time. While this is
physically motivated, defining distances in such a space is not trivial. They
are highly dependent on the chosen metric, which defines how time correspondsto
space. This already implies that the choice of metric contains certain
assumptions and can be adapted to specific preferences. The essential parameter
is the factor $\alpha$, which transfers time to space and vice versa:
%
\begin{equation}
  c_{t} = \alpha \cdot t \, .
  \label{eq:metric}
\end{equation}
%
The choice of this parameter e.g. gives the possibility to prefer spatial
distance over timing information, or the opposite. The spacetime of the
point-cloud is quantized in all its three dimensions: the pixels of the camera
define the spatial grid, whereas the time slices, each event is binned to, do so
for the timing information. When trying to separate air-showers from
background via the density of the shower's photons, the distance plays the
essential role. The natural way to equalize between space and time is to adapt
to the photon distribution of a typical air-shower along each axis. So, by
choosing
%
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = 0.35\cdot10^9\,\si{\degree\per\second}
\end{equation}
%
the one-dimensional density distribution of photons along the coordinates
$c_x$, $c_y$ and $c_t$ is the same. With this metric, the distance between two
photons $a$ and $b$ is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
  d_{a,b} = \sqrt{(c_x^a - c_x^b)^2 + (c_y^a - c_y^b)^2 + (c_t^a - c_t^b)^2}
\end{equation}

The twodimensional projections of the point-cloud within this metric are shown
in \autoref{fig:pc} for an example air-shower event. With the calculated
degree-equivalent of time the air-shower shows a similar distribution in
each dimension.

%

\subsection{Density-based Clustering with DBSCAN}
%
To find clusters of photons within the space described above, the PhotonStream
uses the \textit{density-based algorithm for discovering clusters with noise}
(DBSCAN) \cite{DBSCAN}. The DBSCAN is well suited for finding air-showers with the
PhotonStream's observables, when choosing the right parameter set for the algorithm. This
algorithm either assigns each extracted photon to one of potentially multiple
clusters or identifies it as a night-sky-background photon. There are no
assumptions on the shape, location or number of the clusters. The algorithm is
characterized by only two parameters.
%
\begin{description}[align=right]
  \item[m] the minimum number of photons to make up a cluster
  \item[$\symbf{\varepsilon}$] the maximum distance between two photons to be considered dense
\end{description}
%
These two parameters represent the specific topology of the air-shower events
by giving limits on typical shower sizes and spreads in spacetime. For
air-shower events recorded by FACT the best choice was found to be $m = 20$ and
$\varepsilon = \SI{0.45}{\degree}$. So, to survive the cleaning, every found
cluster must at least contain 20 photons within a maximum distance of
$\SI{0.45}{\degree}$ to the respective closest photon. The algorithm determines
the clusters by iterating over the photons in 4 steps:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item loop over photons until a dense region with at least $m$ photons is found
  \item add photons to the newly found cluster that are within distance $\varepsilon$ or connected via a chain of dense photons
  \item if nothing to add to cluster restart 1. with leftover photons
  \item mark all photons not assigned to any dense cluster as night-sky-background
\end{enumerate}
%
This way every photon is either belonging to a cluster of an air-shower, or
discarded as background. This determination is taking place in the whole space
of observables the whole time. There are no intermediate steps, only taking
single observables into account, which very much represents a way to find
air-showers in a space well suited for describing them. Furthermore, this way
single photons are selected rather than specific pixels. When expecting
background photons also within signal pixels, this should yield a cleaned image,
closer to the true air-shower image.

\section{Parametrization of Events}
\label{sec:params}
%
For the classical analysis the detected images need to be parametrized. The
learning algorithms work with specific features rather than the whole image,
although there are indeed ways to analyze single pixels.

The parametrization that is most frequently chosen for IACT data is based on
the one proposed by Hillas~\cite{Hillas}. It operates on the two dimensional
images recorded by the cameras, calculating features of the air-shower pixels.
In the original publication these features were used to successfully analyze
images on a 37-pixels camera. The parametrization is based on the light
distribution among the air-shower pixels by calculating the eigenvalue
decomposition of the covariance. A graphical representation of a typical
air-shower image is shown in \autoref{fig:hillas}.
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering%
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Plots/hillas.pdf}%
  \caption{A graphical representation of a typical air-shower image. The figure shows the number of photons per pixel of an air-shower. The dotted
  line represents the air-shower axis. It corresponds to the line minimising the
  sum of perpendicular angular distance, weighted by the number of photons per
  pixel. The standard deviations along this axis and the perpendicular axis are
  the two features called length and width. The centre of
  gravity (cog) of the air-shower image is the two dimensional weighted
  mean of all shower pixels.}%

The figure shows the number of photons per pixel of an air-shower. The dotted
line represents the air-shower axis. It corresponds to the line minimising the
sum of perpendicular angular distance, weighted by the number of photons per
pixel. The standard deviations along this axis and the perpendicular axis are
the two features called \textbf{length} and \textbf{width}. The centre of
gravity (\textbf{cog}) of the air-shower image is the two dimensional weighted
mean of all shower pixels. The position and orientation of the shower is also
characterized by the angle \textbf{delta}. It is the angle between the shower
axis and the camera's $x$-axis. The \textbf{size} of the air-shower simply
corresponds to the sum of photons measured in all air-shower pixels.

To further parametrize the air-showers also higher order statistical moments of
the light distributions are used. Those are the third (\textbf{skewness}) and
fourth (\textbf{kurtosis}) statistical moments of the air-shower photons along
the two axes defined above. The values are calculated in a rotated system in
respective to the camera system, so that the two main axes define the
coordinate axes.
%
\begin{align}
  \text{skew}(X) &= \text{E}\left[\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^3\right] \label{eq:skew} \\
  \text{kurt}(X) &= \text{E}\left[\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^4\right]  \label{eq:kurt}
\end{align}
%
Additional to the size of an air-shower the \textbf{number of pixels}
containing air-shower photons is used as a feature.
%
\section{Reconstruction of the Source Position}
\label{sec:source_pos}%
%
FACT is a single telescope and therefore has no stereoscopic features to
determine the origin of the cosmic ray showers. Thus, specific techniques only
using the features of the air-shower images have to be performed. In this
analysis the so called disp-method is used. It estimates the origin position of
the cosmic gamma-rays by calculating the disp and estimating the sign. The two
dimensional problem of determining $x$ and $y$ coordinates is turned into a
regression task and a classification task. The estimated source position within
the camera's image is assumed to be on the shower's main axis. To find this
position the first step is to estimate the distance to the cog of the
air-shower. disp is representing that distance of the estimated source inside
the camera. As described earlier the fraction of width and length is dependant
on the angle under that the air-shower is hitting the camera. Thus, it is
"pointing" to the cosmic origin of the shower. To estimate \texttt{disp}
\textbf{[FORMULA]}.
%
\begin{equation}
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}
%
The second step is to determine the direction of disp along
the main axis. As shown in \autoref{fig:disp_amb} the distance disp alone is
not sufficient to determine the source position, but an additional direction is
needed. Otherwise there remained an ambiguity, as shown in the two examples.
The assumption of the origin position being on the shower axis reduces this
task to a binary classification of the sign of \texttt{disp}.
%
\begin{figure}
  \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Plots/hillas_4.pdf}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Plots/hillas_5.pdf}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Ambiguity of the reconstruction direction along an example shower's main axis. The calculated \texttt{disp} can be applied to two directions along the shower axis and therefore needs to be determined as well.}
  \label{fig:disp_amb}
\end{figure}
%
The reconstructed source position can then be validated by comparing it to the
known source position as shown in \autoref{fig:disp}. The calculated distance
between the both is labelled $\theta$ and source specific.

\section{Image Cleaning with pixelbased Thresholds}
\label{sec:thresh}
%
When using the largest pulse representation (LP), there is a different cleaning
used. Since the PhotonStream is a different representation, of course the
optimal cleaning differs. When cleaning LP data an algorithm working on the PE
of the pixels is used. This cleaning is based on the assumption that air-shower
images contain a certain minimum number of photons per pixel and appear in a
quite small range of time and space within one event. It does not contain any
assumptions on the number of clusters per event, but with the mentioned
assumptions generally implies a certain topology within the camera's
coordinates. Since arrival times in this representation are properties per
pixel the time correlation has to be given between neighboring pixels. The
algorithm executes the following steps [paper]:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item find pixels containing more photons than an upper threshold $t_1$ (5~p.e.)
  \item remove pixels with less than 2 neighbors above $t_1$
  \item add neighbors of remaining pixels that are above a lower threshold $t_2$ (2.5~p.e.)
  \item remove pixels that have less than 2 neighbors arriving in $\SI{5}{\nano\second}$ time window
  \item remove single pixels with less than 2 neighbors
  \item remove pixels that have less than 2 neighbors inside a $\SI{5}{\nano\second}$ time window
\end{enumerate}
%
The remaining pixels are considered to be the cleaned image. When projecting
the PhotonStream data into a camera image and calculating the mean arrival
times per pixel, unlike the threedimensional DBSCAN, this cleaning can
equivalently be performed on PhotonStream data.
