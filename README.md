Master thesis on the topic: __Analysis of the Crab Nebula using Photon Stream Data observed by the First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope__

In imaging air Cherenkov astronomy, the cosmic radiation is observed via the
secondary particles it produces in Earth's atmosphere. These high-energy secondary
particles cause the emission of Cherenkov light, which is measured by the
Cherenkov telescopes' optical cameras. From this light, information on the
cosmic radiation can be derived, to learn about the characteristics of the
cosmic sources. The data, Cherenkov telescopes produce, consists of
properties derived from the time series of measured voltages. These properties
strongly depend on the detector's readout hardware. This work focuses on a new
data representation, developed by Sebastian Mueller: the PhotonStream. It
consists of single reconstructed photons and opens new possibilities for
analyses throughout the field of Cherenkov astronomy. In this work, a first analysis of this new data representation is
performed. To do so, openly accessible data of the First G-APD Cherenkov
telescope is used. Alongside the results of origin reconstruction, gamma hadron
separation and energy reconstruction, detailed investigations on the
PhotonStream's properties and differences to the classical approach are
presented.
